Barber.             Clif was a father, husband, brother,             uncle, grandfather, cousin, and guiding             light of the Barber-Bolling tribe. He             continues to be dearly missed.                   Clif loved his family very much.             He was also very passionate about the             family reunion newsletter, a project he             initiated and to which he devoted a sig-             nificant amount of time. From the outside, much of this time             seemed devoted to rounding up annual updates from chronically             recalcitrant family members, but what most of us saw did not             even include the time and labor of assembling the newsletter             itself (no small task). It was truly a labor of love. He was ada-             mant that the newsletter tied our family together, especially by             including those of us who cannot physically make the journey             each year — and he was completely right. Therefore it is in his             honor that we continue this annual tradition. I — and any who             follow in his footsteps — may not have his skill in keeping track             of everybody from year to year, but I will do my very best to             carry out what he believed in so strongly.

							<h4>I. Hotel/Location Review</h4>
							<br>
							<h6>Hotel</h6>
							
							<ul class="dashed">
							<li>Staff was very responsive, very helpful, very accommodating.</li>
							<li>They bent over backwards to support us, especially the manager, who especially accommodating.</li>
							<li>We should endeavor to leave positive feedback on the email that they send upon check out.</li>
							<li>Some changes had to be made to the reservation, and some had issues with their reservations. We will find out upon check out after this meeting whether or not everything worked out.</li>
							<li>Some of the difficulty was in not with the hotel by phone directly, but rather in calling the general 1800 Hilton number.</li>
							<li>The room designs are a little strange; the way the bathrooms doors closed was a little alarming.</li>
							<li>Some of the issues are due to the fact that the property is brand new. Good sides and downsides due to the hotel’s newness.</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<h6>Beaufort</h6>
							
							<ul class="dashed">
							
							<li>The welcome center “tour” was very nice.</li>
							<li>Anytime we can relate current experiences with the past is very meaningful.</li>
							<li>A lot of people had their interest piqued by the knowledge they learned. The tour was exceptionally insightful.</li>
							<li>Having John there able to relate the history in a local way was a unique touch!</li>
							<li>Dorothy and her crew in particular felt that it was the best part of the trip.</li>
							<li>It was cool that our stay synced up with the Beaufort water festival as well.</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<h6>Restaurants</h6>
							
							<br>
							<h6 style="font-weight: 600;">Saturday</h6>
							
							<ul class="dashed">
							<li>The parking worked out, we were pleasantly surprised.</li>
							<li>The location was perfect and the service was fantastic. For example, they prepared our to go baskets themselves instead of leaving it to us.</li>
							<li>The host was even gracious enough to leave his station and take our group picture.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<br>
							<h6 style="font-weight: 600;">Friday</h6>
							
							<ul class="dashed">
							<li>The recommendation came from friends of friends (Doris/Roz).</li>
							<li>Having that kind of local resource is always helpful on these trips.</li>
							<li>The food was amazing!</li>
							<li>This was the first time we planned it out ahead of time, because of the Beaufort festival going on.</li>
							<li>For the future, we should aim to continue to plan it out ahead of time because we frequently have a 20+ person reservation.</li>
							</ul>
<br>
							<h4>II. Newsletter/Website Review</h4>
<br>
<h6>Newsletter</h6>

<ul class="dashed">
<li>Biaggi said there are some stragglers. Some people sent things in the last minute, just one or two updates — and that’s fine, if that’s easier than a whole update. its better than nothing. Procrastination seems to be the main issue.</li>
<li>Sending pictures and texts year round is fine; more pictures are needed from people.</li>
<li>We need a repository of family members’ numbers, emails, and addresses — we need an overall spreadsheet.</li>
<li>Would like to include a pet corner next year.</li>
<li>The cost for printing was $197 which was under our estimate. Office Depot was very helpful. Everything went surprisingly well, without any issues. It ended up being so cheap that Biaggi printed extra.</li>
<li>Next year, she might send it to an office depot closer to the reunion location.</li>
<li>Managing the extra copies: other people should volunteer to bring copies, if Biaggi has a list then we can send it to whoever. More copies can be printed if necessary; there is no minimum amount require.</li>
<li>See website: the newsletter will also is be available online, through pdf, as an ebook of sorts.</li>
<li>As the official communications person, we should also coordinate with Karen for newsletter stuff going forward to streamline the process.</li>
<li>Cliffs jokes were missed this year — Debbie and Ajshay offered to find jokes for next year.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h6>Website</h6>

<ul class="dashed">
<li>Biaggi asked for names and addresses in the newsletter submission form and therefore has the beginnings of a spreadsheet for as a directory. This includes phone numbers, physical addresses, and emails. </li>
<li>She is trying to develop the best way to incorporate this information on the website in a way that is still private (restricted to family members).</li>
<li>Joye had sign in book but unfortunately nobody has signed in.</li>
<li>Biaggi hopes to develop a consistent news feed portion of the website, that would put up new updates as they happen outside of social media.</li>
<li>Having a regular email list and send out quarterly update, would help keep us in touch throughout the year</li>
<li>Ajshay offered to help send any type of quarterly reminders.</li>
<li>Suggestion: look into adding a national map in order to better visualize family member locations via map markers.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h4>III. Expense Report (Roz)</h4>
<br>
<ul class="dashed">
<li>We collected ~$2250 in registration fees. We had $1096 in carry over.</li>
<li>The money out was a little bit less because usually we provide complimentary registration for young kids and students, and unfortunately many of them were unable to make it this year.</li>
<li>The hospitality suite and food throughout the weekend should be in the $300 range, we will find that number at the every end.</li>
<li>The newsletter was budgeted a bit higher than what we spent this year.</li>
<li>There was a Penn center charge for the organized tour, but it was worth the expense (about $150).</li>
<li>We came into this reunion with almost $1100, and we collected $75 per adult. In order for that expense to covers kids and the students in college, we may need to increase that amount.</li>
<li>30 paying adults, plus 5 “guests” divided by $3100 budget means that the expense will need to be about $25 higher ($100 a person), assuming we are able to have at least 30 people attend each year.</li>
<li>The dinner was about $45 a person without dessert, with tip and tax it was about $56 a person (without the $20 extra that it usually is gets to the hospitality suite).</li>
<li>We also have had other options in past years where we have done a backyard BBQ (for example, as we did in Montgomery). Outside of similar circumstances, we have come to expect dinner fees.</li>
<li>We are often within the 20-30 person range, and so the attendance of one family can really affect the budget. For example, we would have had less money received vs money spent if we had had more students attend this year.</li>
<li>We still intend on providing a monetary gift for weddings and graduations.</li>
<li>Motion: give Roz a graduation benefit from the family reunion? Motion granted!</li>
<li>Upcoming: Danielle is having a wedding and Kendall graduating next year (2 expected gifts).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>IV. Planning for Next Year’s Reunion</h4>
<br>
<ul class="dashed">
<li>Lamar’s suggestions: shift every three years the responsibility to a group of people based on their location.</li>
<li><strong>Anne Arundel</strong> (brought up by Biaggi/Ajshay)
<ul><li>It is right next to Maryland Live casino and 15 minutes from the airport.</li>
<li>It does not have much historic significance but it is close to DC and Baltimore and as a lot of historical significance. </li>
<li>The prices for the hotels were reasonable.</li> 
<li>Medieval Times is right next to it and there is a huge mall (Arundel Mills).</li> 
<li>There is the biggest African American history museum nearby in DC (about 45 min away) with a whole gamut of DC attractions.</li> 
<li>90 minutes from Annapolis, Frederick Douglass’ house is there but its far.</li>
<li>Close to Ajshay’s new house in Catonsville MD (as of late July).</li>
<li>Transportation while there is a concern, should make that clear because it is not cost effective. We could potentially rent a van to help with transportation, or volunteer local vehicles, for those of us who may not have to rent a room.</li>
<li>It is pretty far for just about everyone not coming from DC/Baltimore.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cruise</strong> (brought up by Kendall)- 
<ul>
<li>A cruise would depend on circumstances regarding finances, which can fluctuate year to year.</li>
<li>Some people aren’t cool with the ocean.</li>
<li>It has some real traction, several people have discussed it -- planning it a few years in advance would be good, not 7 days but more like 3 days and some of them leave from Charleston, Florida, Baltimore, etc.</li>
<li>4-day cruise from Nassau to Charleston (Kendall) says planning  few years in advance gets you better prices. you pay a deposit down generally, not pay upfront.</li>
<li>We would need to know how much money when -- it would be a different model, all inclusive and no dues.</li>
<li>The planning group will be written up for a future year but Kendall, Kennedy, and Kemba will be a part of it.</li>
<li>As a note, John and Vita don’t do boats.</li>
<li>Mississippi river cruise?</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Jekyll Island?</strong> very expensive but was a suggestion in the past ($500).</li>
<li>Tricia has wanted somewhere in <strong>Penn, Hershey Park</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Norfolk, VA</strong>- it was expensive, we looked at it last year.</li>
<li>Renting a house- we should take a look at renting a house for the next location.</li>
<li><strong>Richmond</strong> has potential: affordable, up and coming food scene, and more feasible location-wise. It was also just the 400th anniversary of the first slave coming through Virginia in Richmond (1619 anniversary).</li>
<li>NOTE: look into new t-shirts?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h6 style="font-weight: 600;">Two Main Proposals:</h6>
<ol>
	<li>That the Washington group takes on the planning for next year and should come up with a specific proposal.
	<ul class="dashed"><li>Roz, Torch, Biaggi, Ajshay, and Tricia as the planning committee to do research for ANY AREA within DC, Maryland, Virginia, and potentially the Carolinas — we don’t have to stick to the beach.</li></ul></li>
	<li>That the Georgia contingent will take a look at a cruise proposal for a few years out.
	<ul class="dashed"><li>Kemba will serve as the point person.</li></ul></li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<ul class="dashed">
	<li>Last item: a donation is usually given to host church, last year we donated to Jonathan’s theater group. This year’s suggestion is that donations be made out to Roland’s church, who was helpful in working with Doris and Roz our planning for this year. talk to Doris about that.</li>
